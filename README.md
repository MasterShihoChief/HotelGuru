Basic Code Walkthrough
-----------------------------------------
This program utilizes quite a few different technolgies that may overwhelm beginner android programers. This section will go into brief summary of each class

* firstUseSetup.java
 * This is the first Activity that will be started when the app opens no matter what. This app keeps track of a first run and localization user preference variable. If this is the first run then we are going to allow the user enter a username, a password and a desired localization. This form takes care of both regisration and login.
